1. What “coding” actually means
Coding is the act of giving instructions to a computer in a language it understands. Since computers don’t speak human (yet), we use programming languages to translate our thoughts into precise commands.

2. Core concepts

Program: A collection of instructions that tells the computer what to do.

Programming language: The medium used to write those instructions (Python, JavaScript, C++, etc.).

Syntax: The grammar rules of a programming language. Miss a semicolon, and the computer loses its mind.

Variable: A named storage spot for data, like a labeled box you can open later.

Function: A reusable chunk of code that performs a specific task. Think of it as a tiny worker doing one job well.

Algorithm: A step-by-step recipe for solving a problem.

Data types: The kinds of information a program handles—numbers, text, true/false values, etc.


3. How coding actually works
You write text (the code). The computer either interprets it (reads and executes it line by line, like Python) or compiles it (translates the whole thing into machine code first, like C++). Then it executes your instructions without ever questioning your life choices.
